        <h1>Wet Markets in Singapore</h1>
    </div>

        <p>
            <i>Wet markets in Singapore</i> is a data visualisation project that explores the spatial distribution of wet markets and supermarkets in relation to population density. While wet markets have historically played a key role in providing Singaporeans with access to fresh food, they are <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hawker-centres-still-top-choice-of-many-but-wet-markets-continue-to-lose-favour-says">declining in popularity</a> in recent years. More Singaporeans are choosing to shop at supermarkets.   
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> visualises open-source data from data.gov.sg to map the distribution of <a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_a57a245b3cf3ec76ad36d55393a16e97/view">wet markets</a> and <a href="https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_cac2c32f01960a3ad7202a99c27268a0/view">supermarkets</a>, layered over <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/cop2020/sr2/cop2020sr2.pdf">population density</a>. This spatial analysis seeks to answer key questions:  
            <ul>
                <li>Are wet markets evenly distributed throughout the neighbourhoods?</li>
                <li>How accessible are wet markets in an area of high population density?</li>
            </ul>    
            
        </p>
        <p>

            Despite the declining popularity of wet markets, the government continues to invest in upgrading their infrastructure, as seen in projects like the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bukit-timah-market-to-shut-in-2nd-half-of-2024-half-the-stallholders-to-move-to-interim-site">Bukit Timah Market redevelopment</a>. This raises another question: 
            <ul>
                <li> Is the declining popularity of wet markets due to their infrastructure or are there other reasons? </li>
            </ul>
            This question can only be answered through community participation, therefore we have implemented a <i>crowdsourced map</i> that will allow users to report the wet markets they frequent through the Ushahidi platform. This survey seeks to capture public sentiment and understand whether infrastructure plays a role in declining usage, or if other factors—such as convenience or lifestyle change—play a part.
